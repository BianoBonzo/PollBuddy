### Scripts

The backend of this project is composed of JavaScript files, along with other files 
involved with the functionality of running the project in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). 
The main JavaScript files can be found in the **routes** folder. 

### Layout 

Complicated methods require [JSDoc](https://devhints.io/jsdoc) comments in order to fully describe what they do. 
The backend relies on API requests that are made by the frontend. As such, testing out the 
back end requires the use of running the project locally on Docker. Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/PollBuddy/PollBuddy/wiki/Installation-(For-Production)-Instructions) for guidelines.
