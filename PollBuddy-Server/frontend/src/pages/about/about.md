# Welcome to PollBuddy! :D
## An affordable and compatible in-class quizzing platform.

Many professors use iClickers to ask questions or polls to their students. However, iClickers are expensive, bulky, outdated, easy to forget, difficult to integrate with other programs, and only professors can track answers.

Therefore, we decided to create a website that has similar, yet improved functionality of iClickers, called Poll Buddy.

Poll Buddy is a website that professors can use to interact with students during class. Professors will log in to their Poll Buddy account and will be able to create questions. Students will be able to log in to their accounts where they will be able to see the answer options and will be able to get Poll Buddy points for answering them. Both professors and students will be able to see question results and other statistics. Students will be able to view their Poll Buddy points at any time.
